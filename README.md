DISCLAIMER: This has only been tested on macOS. I've pulled this down on a windows machine and have gotten issues where the file parsing is wonky as windows adds an extra /r at the end of each line. 

To run:
1. `npm install`
2. `./index.js <filename> <number of generations to simulate, defaults to 10 if not provided>`

To run tests:
1. `npm test`
